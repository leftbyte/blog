My private blog where I'm journalling my current ML learnings. 

I'm a long time software engineer that has built many systems and I
love learning about and building new and emerging systems. At VMware I
implemented virtual drivers and remoting (display, audio, I/O)
platforms to deliver a top-in-class remote desktop experience. At
Orion, I worked on embedded systems for hardware clients, designed and
implemented backend services, and used modern DevOps practices to
deploy a web-scale multi-region system for Internet connected group
voice communications. At Clip Health I helped build a COVID-19 and Flu
diagnostic platform that used a logistic regression model to provide
fast and accurate results. We also provided first level support and
built tools for the research lab and data science teams. In addition
to the technical aspects of shipping software products, I am also very
passionate about software engineering and the realities of our
craft. I have lead nd built many different types of products, teams,
processes and systems and embrace the continuous learning mindset.
